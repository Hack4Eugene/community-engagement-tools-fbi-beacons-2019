# community-engagement-tools-fbi-beacons-2019

## This project was created for the City of Eugene to help the community realize events that may obstruct their normal daily travel. Additionally, using our app, the people of Eugene will be able to send feedback to an administrator of the City of Eugene.

### This project is built using a LAMP Stack with it being hosted on Amazon Web Services.

### No installation is needed for this web application, simply go to the url: <http://54.214.135.100/community-engagement-tools-fbi-beacons-2019/> and you can see the demonstration of the future implementation of our project.

### Given that this project will eventually be moved to a mobile application, we have provided in the "models" folder a video demo and some assets to demonstrate how it may look in the future.
